Monero Multisig is a project focused on exploring the possibilities of Monero multisignature transactions.

## What is Monero?
Monero is a privacy-focused, open-source cryptocurrency that allows for completely decentralized and private transactions. It is built on a blockchain and uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.

## What is Multisignature?
Multisignature, or multisig, is a feature in cryptocurrency transactions that allows for multiple signatures to be required for a transaction to be considered valid. This provides an additional layer of security and control over funds.

## Our Goal
Our goal with Monero Multisig is to explore the possibilities of this technology and create a secure, user-friendly platform for managing multisignature transactions.
